# Express.js Async Request Handling Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in Express.js when handling asynchronous requests.  The bug occurs when the time taken to process a request exceeds the time the server is waiting for a response. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Bug Description
The provided code uses `setTimeout` to simulate an asynchronous operation. If the processing time (2000ms in this example) exceeds the server's expectation, it might cause issues such as dropped requests or unexpected responses.

## Solution
The solution involves appropriate handling of asynchronous operations, ensuring all necessary cleanup and response handling are performed correctly, regardless of the processing time.
